-- Murder, Death, Chill --

In the year 2035 the world is overrun by non-chill ghosts.
 Chill now only exists inside the souls of a select few.

 Are you a chill enough dude to chill all the ghosts,
    and restore the chill factor of the world?
	
-- Game objective --

Restore the chill factor of the world to 100% by chilling ghosts with your chill ray.
Each ghost chilled will restore 1% of chill.

When touched by a ghost, it will instantly drain the chill from your soul, and you will die.
You may select [continue] to keep going, but at what cost?

If videogames are too hard for you, [chill mode] can be enabled from the main menu.
In this mode, you may freely chill around, with no risk of dying.
This mode may render you _too chill_, so use carefully.

-- WARNING --

Game may trigger seizures, nausea and uncomfortable amounts of chill.
Limit your sessions to at most six hours at the time, and drink lots of waters.
