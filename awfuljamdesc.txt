# Game objective

![](http://i.imgur.com/oRQvl1K.gif)
Restore the **chill** factor of the world to 100% by **chilling** ghosts with your **chill** ray.
Each ghost **chilled** will restore 1% of **chill**.

When touched by a ghost, it will instantly drain the **chill** from your soul, and you will die.
You may select [continue] to keep going, but at what cost?

If videogames are too hard for you, **[chill mode]** can be enabled from the main menu.
In this mode, you may freely **chill** around, with no risk of dying.
This mode may render you **too chill**, so use carefully.

# ==== WARNING ====

![](http://i.imgur.com/TbHi7AL.gif)
Game may trigger seizures, nausea and uncomfortable amounts of **chill**.
Limit your sessions to at most six hours at the time, and drink lots of waters.
